#Hello World!

##I'm Nargiz Aliyeva, a youth advocate, aspiring space engineer, and founder of the Aerospace Engineering and Space Research Club. I'm passionate about blending technology, nature, and human potential to create meaningful impact on Earth and beyond.

- I’ve led award-winning space projects, represented Azerbaijan on global stages, and broken barriers as a young woman in STEM and leadership.

- I’m also a curious botanist, storyteller, and spiritual explorer — proving that science and soul can thrive together.

##My interests include:

- Space Tech, Policy, and Product Management

- AI, Data, and Innovation for Good

- Youth Empowerment, Peacebuilding, and Intercultural Dialogue

- Herbology, Sustainability, and Nature-Based Wisdom

I believe in creating new worlds, not just exploring them.
Let’s connect and build the future together. ✨
